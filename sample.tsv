TEDx talk	The TED Talk is in reference to a Youtube video uploaded by TEDx Talks on August 16th, 2016 with the title "Joke's On Us", in which a high-school Aspecticor in a silly looking suit attempts to present an argument in favor of humor and why it is important in daily life -- Just watch it. Go ahead. Click the link. It speaks for itself. Andrew Will is a Brentwood student hailing from Red Deer, Alberta. He has many interests here at the school, ranging from musical theatre to debate. He is also a dedicated member of the Hockey Squad, although many would describe his position not as a left-wing but more of a left-bench. Being one of 60+ plus students from Alberta, he loves the temperate climate, but misses the piles of snow and the decent hockey teams back home (The Calgary Flames).	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuXoLoMnoww

Bird%	Bird% is the Hitman speedrun that all have been raven about. You have to fly through all the maps as quickly as possible without doing anything ill-eagle while only using the blue mascot da-skies. Starting in Parrot, France, Owlspecticor must assassinate Dalia Mallardgolis by dropping a chandelier on her, quacking her skull. In Flapienza, he must ignore the birds of pray in the church and instead head underground, eliminating a dangerous bird flu. In Marrakeet, he passes the people eggs-ercising their right to protest and head inside of the Swallow consulate. In Bangkokatrice, Jordan Crane is quacked on his bird-day while Ken "The Chick" Morgan poses no threat to our fine-feathered hitman, and goes down without so much as a hoot. In Coloradodo, Sean Crows, Ezra Bird and his crow-nies go down without a flight. In Hawkaido, ICA leader Erich Sparrows gets no special tweetment and leaves Diana feeling emu-tional. -- Moving to Hawk's Bay, Alma Flynard gets pecked by a syringe and her eagle-eyed guards can't spot Owlspecticor. In Flyami, Owlspecticor eggs-ecutes Sierra Hawks as the crowd hoots and hollers. In Santa Flamingo, he puts an end to the Caw-caine production in one fowl swoop. In Magpie, India, Dawoodpecker Robin thinks he's an up and coming comedi-hen, but is sent crashing down to Earth. Penguittleton Beak might seem more serene, but Owlspecticor goes stork raven mad and eliminates his long-forgotten foster feather. He then pays a visit to the Stork Society on the Isle of Seagull, is in impeckable form as he ends the bill-ionaires. In New Yolk, Owlspecticor has the option to crash the stork market, but instead goes cheep and gives Athenosprey his season's tweetings. Across the pond in the Maldoves, Tyson Billiams is feeling under the feather and Owlspecticor makes it worse by robin him of his life. -- In Dufly, he says "beakaboo" to Carl Wingram and Marcus Storkvescent. In Larkmoor, not far from Duckingham Palace, he is presented with a case to quack, but chooses to instead go quackers on Alexa Quailisle. In Birdlin, Owlspecticor tells his pursuers that toucan play at that game, and hunts them down until he's owl by himself. In Chongkingfisher, China, he gives Emugen Royce a wound not even the best duck-tor could heal. Hendoza, his hen-ultimate location, Heron Archibald Eagle was not emu-sed by Diana and got flown up by a rubber ducky. Finally, in the Cardinal Mountains, a guard asks if they are in U-crane, but they are in fact in Crow-mania. Owlspecticor ends this saga by making The Ostrich's memory crow away. -- I hate my life	0	https://clips.twitch.tv/AdorableFunZebraCoolStoryBob-3NLczGR4A8LhXmTa

TheaterBoy	In his high school years, Aspect was quite the theater boy, being featured on his schools YouTube channel with an inspiring quote about community. He can also be seen doing flips and flying around on a wire, which is the subject of the TheaterBoy emote. Years after his final act as a theater kid, Aspecticor made one final grasp at finding that glory from his olden days. Just like he had flown around on stage years earlier, Aspecticor took a rope and tied one end around a ceiling fan, and the other around his waist. However, the fan could not support his weight, and he had to be sent to the hospital from injuries sustained after the ceiling fan came crashing down on top of him.	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7etcfw2iA

real voice	Aspecticor's real voice, as known to people who have met him in real life, is quite high-pitched and tinny, almost like a Canadian Mickey Mouse. It's a wonder that people tolerate his presence. Understandably, he uses a voice changer to sound more masculine to be taken seriously whenever he's on stream. At time, this voice changer breaks and for brief moments, his natural voice can be heard.	1	https://clips.twitch.tv/SweetInspiringBeanTwitchRPG-a5rHjRzbnXs8ORld
MASTER	back before he played freelancer (hardcore just doesn't have that same ring to it), he speedran SA/SO trilogy on the Master difficulty because counterintuitively, he wasn't good enough for the Professional difficulty.

WACKASSNAILS	WACK ASS NAILS, often followed by a LULW, is a reference to the fact that Aspecticor has self-proclaimed wack ass nails. They are strangely and inexplicably short, a fact which has led to many sleepless nights and tormented days. My his own admission, it is a "great shame" he holds.	1	https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpConsiderateYakWOOP-2nX23V6jmkeTcovz
Slurspecticor	"Slurspecticor" is a moniker given to Aspecticor in reference to his ongoing trend of saying politically incorrect and offensive statements on stream. On February 2nd, 2022, while streaming HITMAN III, Aspecticor made a shocking admission. Out of nowhere, he brazenly stated that he sometimes slurs. This clip was clipped by QornOnTheQob, therefore, they made the moniker originally. Shocked and appalled, his audience took to Twitter with the #CancelAspecticor, which reached #3 trending in Red Deer. Aspecticor ended stream and returned a day later pretending to be sad, but it wasn't very convincing when he was splashing the fake tears on his face on camera as he apologized. Eventually, following an enlightening reading of 1984, Aspecticor began to ban all mentions of a "slur incident". However, because he is lazy, he eventually gave up at this, and his fans began calling him "Slurspecticor".

RefreshChatOverlayIUploadedAnotherEmote	Aspecticor's stream chat overlay has the unfortunate feature of not being able to refresh in real time as an emote is added, as the mods are wont to do. This leaves a very funny emote, in the form of a picture or video, being unable to render on screen and just be another word. Because we cannot have stream be reduced to what the mobile users basically see on a daily basis, we require that the chat overlay be refreshed posthaste.	1	https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/60b1657f81bdd27f2b44fd0d/4x.webp

Coffee Cow	Based on the popular "Coffee Cow" joke from r/atrioc, Aspecticor whipped out his most successful parody song to date. Sitting at 52K views at the time of writing, it is one of the most popular leech songs, surpassing his previous most popular song "Glizzy Man," and only second to the song compilations that Atrioc himself posted, "ONE LAST HIT," and PeyTheMusician's "The Tale of the Coffee Cow." For much of its history, the video has been unlisted, like at the time of its release. When it was first made public a few days later, views skyrocketed and would only later be surpassed by his Hitman speedrun explained videos. Right now, unfortunately, like most of his other content (especially related to Atrioc), it is unlisted, despite a union motion to the contrary.	1	https://youtu.be/aSGPUf607vE

Johnathan (Elusive Target)	Johnathan is the most successful musician in the universe and an icon in the Aspecticor stream community. According to his mission briefing, his first album was downloaded 50 million times in its first 3 months of release. This feat has not been accomplished since the invention of iTunes, making Johnathan the objective bad boy of music. The part that makes Johnathan near and dear to Aspecticor fans, however, is not his music, but his history of having committing a multiple homicide. Just like the streamer himself, he was never punished and even went on to create more music after. Johnathan's godly visage has inspired a number of emotes in the community, such as "Johnathan", "Nonhathan", "HYPERJOHNATHAN", "GIGAJOHNATHAN", and "JohnathanDespair". If anyone is caught using the blasphemous emote "Drake" instead of the lordly emote "Johnathan" they will be sentenced to 14 years hard labor in the Asylum.	2	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aspecticor/images/e/e8/Johnathan2.gif/revision/latest?cb=20220808035810
Fartmoor :tf:	"Fartmoor" is the funniest joke ever made in Aspecticor's chat and a true miracle of wordplay. Combining Dartmoor, a map in HITMAN III, with the word "fart", Fartmoor is surely to elicit laughter wherever it appears. It is often paired with the trollface emote, to indicate the whimsical and mischievous nature of the joke.	2	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aspecticor/images/8/86/Fartmoor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20220316024046
!mastery	I got a couple questions one is I noticed you’re on level one during the game through how is it you got all of the stuff unlocked on level one mastery?  Because I also see you The bottom right it says mastery level one of one that’s on all levels you’re playing i’m afraid that clearly shows a modified game file. two Can you do this on a council not just a PC? I have my doubts because you might have modified file system on your PC due to the fact that you have all of the items unlocked and you’re at mastery level one. If you can do this on an Xbox series X or PS five or four I would be impressed then. Otherwise I have my doubts that’s probably why Ioi Interactive don’t really make big noise when people post these especially when they’re on a PC.PC games can be modified Council games cannot. I’m not really interested in speed running because I like to enjoy the craftsmanship that the developers put into the game!

Muffin Boy	Back when Aspecticor used to speedrun trilogy, he used muffin skips a lot. He also failed (Muffed) them a lot, but that's besides the point. Aspecticor used them so much, he eventually talked about them in a video that gained millions of views, with many comments talking about how crazy it was that a simple muffin was used to break the game. Naturally, IOI caught wind of this, and put an end to this tomfoolery at once, so that normal people could finally enjoy the game. At least, that's one way it happened. They say that it was an accidental patching when fixing another feature and they never intended to harm the speedrunning meta. But let's be real, that was just polite talk after Aspecticor released the hit video "The Update That Could Kill Hitman Speedrunning." And that video has a blueberry muffin right in the center of the thumbnail. What a muffin boy	2	https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/635f125d663949494fc9e7df/4x.webp

Long hair	Aspecticor once had long ginger hair, reminiscent of Manny the mammoth from Ice Age. Unfortunately (or fortunately, because it's crazy he thought he could pull it off), he has a rare form of really fast male-pattern hair loss, so the long hair era is long over. The emote Aspecticles in chat is but a solemn reminder of what once was.	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/UnusualAbstruseGalagoBatChest-WF0qkPJhXj1PXWyV
Uptown Funk	On July 9th, 2015, a video was uploaded by the title "Andrew W - Concert for a Summer's Eve 2015", in which the titular Andrew W, also known as Aspecticor, performs a live rendition of Bruno Mars's "Uptown Funk". All things considered, it actually isn't too bad. Unlike the TED Talk, he likely had some idea of what he was going to do more than 15 minutes before getting on stage. However, small things like the comically oversized suit and the trumpet players having an aneurysm at 2:30 turn a decent performance into a comedy masterpiece.	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7bG3UbOXqQ

When he goes too long without shrooms, he will start to become restless and laugh at everything. Aspecticor first revealed his shrooms addiction during a Halo Infinite Stream. Fellow Atrioc leech Syk1k confronted Aspecticor about his drug usage, asking what drugs he does. In response, Aspecticor answered "Shrooms." Nobody spoke a word for the next 15 minutes until Aspecticor broke the silence by laughing out of nowhere and then walking off stream for 5 minutes. When he came back, he acted like nothing happened. After this incident, his fans began to call him "Shroomspecticor".	2	https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/emotesv2_6bf174b0227d4b6f972ced5a445bc105/default/dark/3.0
ASPECTICORING	Because Aspecticor somehow found success as a speedrun documentary YouTuber, he finds the incessant need to explain every little thing (somehow still chat doesn't know what an elusive target is). This is a video of him in action, unedited in any form	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/ViscousTacitCakeDuDudu-JPFV8LXUhBha-eTK
VGHS	RocketJump web series, played a lot during subathon sleep segments.	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/PricklyIncredulousRavenSuperVinlin-zx4p_stOcL1PaqYW
Elastigirl	During the subathon, he watched the Incredibles movie series, in which he consumed copious amounts of alcohol (see Alcoholicor) and ogled Elastigirl. After fulfilling a donation goal, he ordered a cardboard cutout of Elastigirl to be placed in the background of his stream. The Elastigirl cutout was very popular with chatters, with them donating gift subs in order to have their name signed on the Elastigirl cutout. Unfortunately, it was probably not as popular with the females living with Aspecticor (being his cousin and his cat). One day the Elastigirl cutout disappeared and was never seen again.	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/PopularIcyArmadilloMcaT-WMyV10KKMoRMgbbL

TypicalSoyGameExploiter	This emote features a clip of Aspect's webcam taken from his attempt of the DougDoug GTA Challenge in which he has an exaggerated response to surviving a perilious situation. The name of the comment is in reference to a comment on one of Aspect's YouTube videos, calling him a "typical soy game exploiter" for using cheats in his speedrun instead of pulling himself up by his bootstraps the good ol' fashioned way. 	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/FriendlyDeliciousLorisEagleEye-GmRS8_tHVDB0nErG
subathon nightmare	He had a glimpse of his future self as a content creator, or an even scarier possibility: the present.	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/FineGleamingNuggetsBCWarrior-OgZyyPFNfDPJMtyH
JK+ Incident	Whilst playing Jump King, chatter B1ink01 made multiple attempts to get Aspect to install a mod known as JK+, which allows multiple people to play on the same map and see each other if they pass each other. On top of this, B1ink01 made no secret of his Jump King proficiency, and was ready to dust Aspect the second he installed JK+. However, he was banned instead and Aspect proceeded to rant for 14 hours about people wanting attention for things they are good at. B1ink01 may as well have been permabanned if not for mods advocating on their behalf, and now they're an oldhead of the stream.	2	
TTS Brian	Before the rise of AI and their deeper involvement in text-to-speech technology (TTS), all TTS requests were read out by Brian. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the messages were no less psychotic.	2	https://clips.twitch.tv/BlitheResourcefulPuppyMingLee-kkAgCf7KYNr0hp-K
he fell in the toilet :(	When Aspecticor leaves stream, he often takes minutes at a time. One possible explanation is that due to his miniature stature, he falls into the toilet and is spending those precious minutes off-screen climbing for his life to escape the sewers below.	2	https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/62f49438f4cbcdff572246ad/4x.webp

El Tigre / Dr. Fauci	El Tigre is Aspecticor's name for his own Fall Guys bean, because of its orange and black striped pattern. Atrioc was wearing a mask to hide a terrible sore on his mouth, so instead he called him Dr. Fauci, knowing that this would turn him off from his target demographic of right-wingers and fellow Tucker Carlson watchers.	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6bZd_wg4k8
